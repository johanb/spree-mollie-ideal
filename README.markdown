SpreeMollie
===========

__Don't let the *1-3-stable* branch name fool you. This is far from stable atm. The branch name just indicates which version of Spree it targets.__

This spree extension adds [Mollie](http://www.mollie.nl/) as a payment provider.


Testing
-------

Be sure to bundle your dependencies and then create a dummy test app for the specs to run against.

    $ bundle
    $ bundle exec rake test_app
    $ bundle exec rspec spec
